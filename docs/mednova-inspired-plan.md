## MedNova → RL-Tutor-Project: Inspiration & Adaptation Plan

Date: 2025-10-25

This document summarizes key ideas from the MedNova project (https://github.com/medgineer-ind/MedNova) and maps them into a concrete, prioritized plan to adapt and implement similar features in the RL-Tutor-Project (an AI + RL-based learning app for JEE aspirants).

### Quick summary of MedNova (what to borrow)
- Purpose: AI-powered study assistant (NEET-focused) with personalized planners, quizzes, chapter-wise practice, doubt-solving, progress analytics.
- Stack: TypeScript frontend (Vite/React), modular components, services, uses a large model API (Gemini) via an API key, simple app scaffolding (components, services, App.tsx).
- UX surface: planners (daily/weekly/monthly), interactive quizzes, instant doubt resolution, progress dashboards.

### Why this is useful for RL-Tutor-Project (JEE-focused)
- Personalized planners and adaptive practice map directly to our learning goals.
- MedNova’s use of LLMs for planning/doubt-solving can complement our RL agent that personalizes sequencing and difficulty.
- Clean componentization (components/services) is a good pattern to follow in the Next.js app under `app/` and `components/`.

## Proposed feature set to adapt (prioritized)

1) Core (MVP) — high value, low risk
  - Personalized study planner (daily/weekly) generated by an LLM prompt + tuned rules. Input: exam date, topics, available hours. Output: schedule items.
  - Adaptive quiz engine (chapter-wise practice) that records responses and difficulty, exposes an API for the RL agent to update/choose next questions.
  - Progress dashboard: strengths/weaknesses by topic, simple charts.

2) Important (next)
  - Instant doubt-solving via LLM (with citations / step-by-step solutions specialized for JEE style problems).
  - Integration between LLM planner and RL agent: planner proposes schedule; RL agent personalizes the next question or subtopic based on learner state.

3) Advanced (future)
  - Full RL-based curriculum optimizer acting on sessions, using reward signals from correctness, time-on-question, and learner-reported confidence.
  - Simulation environment for RL (student models or replay buffer) and offline policy evaluation.

## Mapping to this repository (practical file/component suggestions)

- Frontend (Next.js app in `app/`):
  - `components/Planner/PlannerUI.tsx` — UI for planner creation and viewing.
  - `components/Quiz/AdaptiveQuiz.tsx` — quiz player component that calls quiz API, shows explanations.
  - `components/Dashboard/ProgressOverview.tsx` — performance visualization.

- Backend (existing `backend/` Python FastAPI/Flask or similar):
  - `backend/api/planner.py` — endpoint that accepts user profile and returns a schedule (uses an LLM wrapper or local planner logic).
  - `backend/api/quiz.py` — endpoints: get_question(session, topic, difficulty), submit_answer (records outcome), analytics endpoints.
  - `backend/services/llm_client.py` — wrapper to call LLM API (Gemini, OpenAI, or locally hosted LLM) with safe prompt templates.
  - `backend/services/rl_agent/` — code for RL policy training and inference. Reuse existing `rl-proj/personalized_learning_rl/` as starting point.

- Data & persistence:
  - Student model: sessions, attempts, question metadata, timestamps.
  - Use SQLite/Postgres depending on scale; seed dataset with chapter-wise question banks (JEE-focused) in `backend/data/`.

## Concrete 6-week roadmap (suggested)

Week 1 — Discovery & scaffolding
- Read and adapt MedNova components ideas.
- Add `docs/mednova-inspired-plan.md` (this file).
- Create backend endpoints: `/planner` (mock) and `/quiz/get_question` (mock). Frontend: simple planner form and quiz player stub.

Week 2 — LLM-powered planner + baseline quizzes
- Implement `backend/services/llm_client.py` using configurable provider and safe prompt templates.
- Hook planner UI to backend; allow generating schedules (LLM-backed) and persisting them.

Week 3 — Question tracking & analytics
- Implement `/quiz/submit_answer` to persist responses.
- Build dashboard visualizations for strengths/weaknesses.

Week 4 — RL integration (offline)
- Add RL agent scaffolding: environment interface that consumes session logs and returns next-question selection.
- Run offline experiments on replay logs.

Week 5 — Online RL loop & evaluation
- Add online policy inference: backend endpoint that queries RL policy for next question.
- A/B test RL policy vs baseline heuristics for engagement metrics.

Week 6 — Polish, documentation, tests
- E2E test for planner → quiz → analytics flow.
- Add docs, developer guides, and a reproducible demo dataset.

## Small starter tasks I can implement next (pick 1)
1. Add the planner API endpoint and a mock frontend form that posts to it (fast, shows UX).  
2. Add the quiz API endpoints (get_question, submit_answer) with simple in-memory store and a frontend quiz player.  
3. Add an LLM client wrapper (configurable provider) and a sample prompt template for planner generation.

Recommended first pick: (2) Quiz endpoints + frontend player — because the RL agent needs question/response data first.

## Tech & security notes / assumptions
- I assume this repo will use existing Next.js frontend (in `app/`) and the Python backend under `backend/` — adapt to whichever services you prefer.  
- For LLM calls: keep API keys out of source (use env vars). Implement rate-limiting, input sanitization, and prompt templates to reduce hallucinations.  
- RL agents require careful reward design (correctness, timeliness, confidence). Start with a simple reward and iterate.

## Files added/edited (this task)
- `docs/mednova-inspired-plan.md` — this document (created).

## Next steps (I can do now)
1. If you confirm, I will scaffold one starter task from the list above (quiz endpoints + frontend player recommended).  
2. I can also produce a more detailed design for the RL environment (state, actions, rewards) if you'd like.

If you'd like me to proceed with scaffolding a starter feature, tell me which item to implement first (1, 2 or 3) or ask for modifications to this plan.

Assumptions: the `app/` Next.js project and `backend/` exist in this repo and are the right targets for frontend/backend work. If you prefer a different layout, tell me and I'll adapt.
